popup menus too big -- seems to be impossible without re-implementing the
popup menu code completely :/

It would be nice to have a drag'n'drop way to edit menus, rather than
clicking 'move up', 'move down', repeatedly

Minor internal matters:

The text in the info dialog boxes is hard-coded and needs to be extract
to resource files

Some XML layout files contain hard-coded text strings
